# CitySathi: The "Instagram" for Civic Governance

> Transforming civic engagement from bureaucratic complaint filing into a social, visual, and community-driven experience.

## 🎯 Overview

CitySathi reimagines how citizens interact with municipal governance by combining the familiar interface of Instagram with the structured backend of CPGRAMS (Central Public Grievance Redress and Monitoring System).

Instead of filing duplicate complaints, citizens can:
- 📸 Post civic issues with photos (like Instagram posts)
- 👍 Upvote existing issues to increase priority
- 📍 Track resolutions in real-time
- ✅ Verify when problems are fixed

## 🚀 Key Innovation

**The Problem:** Traditional complaint systems are clogged with duplicates and lack transparency.

**Our Solution:** 
- **1 Complaint + 50 Upvotes = High Priority** (automatic)
- Visual feed shows existing issues in your area
- Community-powered prioritization
- Auto-escalation when thresholds are met
